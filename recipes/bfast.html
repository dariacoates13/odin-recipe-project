        <li>Grab your pan, place on the stove and set heat to medium low.</li>
        <li>Once your pan has heated up, put 1 tbsp of butter onto your pan.</li>
        <li>When your butter has all melted nicely, place your strips of bacon, <em>(however much you desire),</em>
        onto your pan.</li>
        <li>While your bacon is sizzling, crack as many eggs as you'd like in the area beside your bacon.</li>
        <li>When your eggs and bacon start to get golden, you may flip.</li>
        <li>And finally, when all golden, transfer your bacon and eggs to a <strong>clean</strong> plate, cut up
        some bread and enjoy your breakfast. <em>(Fire demon not included)</em></li>
